# Introduction to JavaScript
**What is JavaScript?**  
JavaScript is a programming language created in 1998 with no relation to Java whatsoever. In fact, the only reason JavaScript is named after Java is because Java was a popular coding language at the time, and JavaScript was a scripting language. Thus, the name came to be (feel free to read more about the language [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Its main uses now are to create web applications, which we see all over the internet.

**Chrome Developer Console**  
There are multiple ways to open the developer console. On Google Chrome specifically, here are a few ways:
  - Click the Three Dots at the Upper Right Corner --> Click "More Tools" --> Click "Develoepr Tools"
  - Shortcut: CTRL + SHIFT + J for Windows & CMD + OPTION + I for Mac OS
  
**Variables**  
A variable is something holds a piece of data. For example,
`var daniel = 0.5;`  
`let a = 1;`   
`const b = false;`  
These are examples of variables which hold a piece of data. However, there are multiple ways to declare a variable. Notice that we used we use "let" and "const" here, however there is also the keyword, "var". The reason these keywords exist because of the revolutionary *ES6 Changes*. Here is an outline of the differences between the different keywords:

- **var**: Common practice to not use var after ES6 change. If you do see var, means that code is not updated. myVar is globally scoped, meaning that the variable can be declared inside a function but accessible from outside the function after the function has been called. [Here is a great link that goes over the meaning of globally scoped in detail.](https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-variable-scope-hoisting/)
- **let**: Added during ES6 change. Variable declared by let is block-scoped. The alternative to using var, since variables can be altered.
- **const**: Added during ES6 change. Variables declared by const cannot be altered later, as const stands for constant. 

Since let and const are more recent, we will always emphasize to **never use *var* when writing modern code**. 

**Semicolons**  
In JavaScript, semicolons are not needed at the end of each line. The following lines have no difference when ran:

`const a = 10`  
`const a = 10;`

So semicolons are unnecessary. However, in industry, it is more common practice to put semicolons at the end of each line, so that is what recommend you do in general.

**Operators**  
This is where JavaScript gets interesting. We recommend you try and guess what each of the following lines will do, and what it ends up doing in the Developer Console.

`2 + 5`  
`5 + ‘2’`  
`2 + 5 + ‘x’`  
`2 + ‘x’ + 5`  
`2 - ‘1.5’`  
`5 * ‘-3’`  
`5 + true`  
`5 * ‘uwu’`  
`8 - ‘huh’`  

Weird, right? What makes JavaScript such an interesting language is that the concept of "type" and "value" are loosely interpreted. Let's take a look a few examples:  

`5 + ‘2’`: Similar to Java, when an integer is added by a string, the integer is casted to a string, and the + symbol is interpreted as a concatenation.  
`2 - ‘1.5’`: Unlike Java, this code actually compiles. As mentioned, JavaScript has a loose interpretation of a variable type & value. As such, with the - operation, JavaScript is able to only look at the *value* of '1.5' and ignore the fact that it is a string. Most object-oriented languages are not able to do this unless through the process of casting.  
`5 + true`: Boolean values can be represented as a 0 or 1, where *false = 0* while *true = 1*. This expression evaluates to be the same as `5 + 1`, thus is 6.  
`8 - ‘huh’`: This expression evaluates to *NaN*, otherwise known as Not-a-Number, which indicates that a value is not a legal number. This expression tries to take the value of 'huh' and subtract it from 8, however this is not possible.  

Besides these, we also want to emphasize how the double equals (==) operation works. Let's take the following example:  

`console.log(5 == '5');`  

Unlike what you might initially think, this expression will actually print **true**. But why? The reason is that once again, JavaScript has a loose interpretation of type and value. THe == operation only checks that two variable's **values** are equal. But what if you wanted to check for a variable's type as well? That is when the triple equals (===) operation is handy.  

`console.log(5 === '5');`  
This expression would evaluate to **false**. This is because although the values are the same, the types are not, as one is an integer while the other is a string. Generally, there is rarely a reason to use double equals (==) over triple equals (===), so in general, try to remember to always just use triple equals (===).  

**Loops**  
A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a specified condition is met. There are two types: a while loop and a for loop.  

*while loop*   
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

*for loop*
```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

In each of the above pieces of code, a counter variable called *i* was initialized to 0. Then after each all lines of code are run from inside the loop, the counter
variable *i* increments by 1. Then, the loop continues until `i < 5` evaluates to false.  

**Objects**  
An object is an unordered collection of data containing key-value pairs (similar to a dictionary in Python or a HashTable in Java). Different key-value pairs in the same object cannot have the same keys.  

```
let obj = {
  "name": Daniel Truong,
  "age": 14`
}
```

# What is Node.js?
Before, JavaScript could only be run on browsers (think about it if you had to do your PAs in your browser. oof). Servers were also only run using technologies such as ASP.NET.  

However, a new JavaScript runtime environment called Node.js was created in 2009, which allows for JavaScript code to be run from a local machine. As such, the development of servers using JavaScript became prominent. So now, JavaScript could be used for client-side and server-side development.  

# Client-Server Model
A **server** is a computer designed to process requests & data which can be loaded into client web pages. For example, let's look at a product such as Facebook. When you make a post through your client, the server will receive the post. Then, since this post exists in the server, other client devices will show the post. Generally, this is how the model works. 

# Steps to Take
We are going to start the back-end development. 
- Create a directory called *server*.
- *cd* into this directory, and run the command, *npm init*.
- Create a new file called *app.js*.
- Open this file and write the line:
  - `console.log("Excited to make memes :)");`
- In your terminal, type *node app.js*  

After these steps, there should be an output "Excited to make memes" in the terminal.  

# npm (node package manager)
**npm (or node package manager)** is a program for node which manages the "packages" and app dependencies. A "package" refers to a piece of software which has already been created and can be imported.  

# JSON & package.json
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Essentially, a JSON file is one object that is used to transmit data objects. A JSON file can be imported into a JavaScript file and its contents can be easily accessed.  
  
When running the *npm init* command, a new file known as *package.json* is created. A *package.json* file is essential for all node applications, as it outlines the specifications for the application. The different aspects of the file can be found in detail [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-package-json/). 

# Steps to Starting a Server
Copy and paste the following code into the *app.js* file.  
```
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);

// Server will always find an open port.
const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;
server.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```  
Next, run the following commands:
- npm install express --save
- npm install http --save

The *npm install* command installs a package into our application, which allows it to be imported. Next, run *node app.js* in order to run the application. Now, the terminal should output "Server listeing on port 3001". 

# Creating Routes and Pages
When accessing certain endpoints, we can send certain responses. Here are a few examples:  
```
// Access example.com/
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("I love HackSchool.");
});

// Access example.com/memes
app.get('/memes', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});
```
These functions are only called when the user tries to go to the corresponding page. In express, these functions have two parameters:
  - endpoint
  - [callback function](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced)
  
This concept will be taught more in depth in Workshop 4. 

That is it for Workshop 2. We recommend going through the slides as this would provide a more detailed explanation.
